        "Petrified" is a project inspired by petrified wood that I saw at the
        American Museum of Natural History. Petrified wood forms when a slice of
        wood turns into stone after being buried for millions of years. Burial
        protects the wood from decay while groundwater permeates its open
        spaces, depositing minerals and preserving the wood’s outer and inner
        structures. The project is an abstract exploration of the relationship
        between one and the other, depicting how the external transforms into
        the other. <br /><br />The project employs the Face Expression
        Recognition API from
        <a
          href="https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html"
          >face-api.js</a
        >
        to recognize and analyze the user's facial expressions captured via
        webcam. It integrates backgrounds featuring images of emotional resonance. This experimentation
        aims to study the dynamics of the user's facial expressions and the
        corresponding emotional states identified through the Face Expression
        Recognition technology.<br><br><br>
